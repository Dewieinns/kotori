Kotori README
#############

    *Kotori* is a multi-channel, multi-protocol data acquisition and graphing toolkit
    based on InfluxDB_, Grafana_, Mosquitto_ and Twisted_.

        - Use convenient software and hardware components for building
          powerful telemetry solutions, test benches and sensor networks.
        - Build upon a flexible data acquisition integration framework.
        - Address all aspects of collecting and storing
          sensor data from a multitude of data sources and devices.

************
Introduction
************
The big picture of the data acquisition integration framework is a system aiming to:

-   Deliver an instant-on experience by providing built-in sensor adapters,
    flexible configuration capabilities, durable database storage and
    unattended graph visualization out of the box.

-   Integrate well with and extend your currently employed
    measurement data acquisition workflow through flexible
    adapter interfaces to commodity or proprietary software
    and hardware components.
